title: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
desc: >-
  Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service
  that enables applications to quickly and reliably queue messages that one
  component of an application can later process. SQS eliminates the complexity
  and overhead associated with managing and operating message-oriented
  middleware, and provides a simple and cost-effective way to decouple the
  components of an application. SQS offers a reliable, highly-scalable, hosted
  queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. It also provides
  a simple web services interface that can be used to access queues, add,
  receive, and delete messages.
