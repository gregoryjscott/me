  C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed in the early
  1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It is a low-level language, meaning it can be used to
  control hardware and memory, and is often used for system programming. C is a
  compiled language, meaning that it is converted into machine code before being
  executed. It is also a structured language, meaning that it is organized into
  functions, which can be called from other parts of the program. C is widely
  used in many applications, including operating systems, embedded systems, and
  scientific computing.
