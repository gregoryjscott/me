By 2014, Epic Charter Schools was on the verge of exponential growth and had already outgrown its initial, manual-based operations. With 1,500 students, the reliance on temporary staff for data entry created a constant backlog, forcing newly enrolled students to wait weeks for curriculum access and exposing the school to unacceptable security risks.

As technical lead, I spearheaded the development of 'bots', a suite of automated services built on AWS. These bots automated over 95% of data entry tasks and were integrated with a new, secure, school-wide single sign-on solution. This automation enabled the school to scale seamlessly, supporting an explosive growth to 60,000 students over seven years and providing teachers with immediate, secure access to the critical digital tools required to educate their students.

## Key Takeaway

The key to the project's widespread adoption lay in a simple change in language. Technical terms like 'workflows' or 'background tasks' were met with confusion. The moment we reframed our automations as 'bots', everyone understood. This provided a simple mental model—a bot could perform a human's task, just faster and without errors—which empowered staff to become active partners in identifying new automation opportunities.
