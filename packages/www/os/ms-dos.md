  MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) is an operating system developed by
  Microsoft for IBM-compatible personal computers. It was the most commonly used
  member of the DOS family of operating systems and was the main operating
  system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early
  1990s. MS-DOS was designed to provide a user-friendly environment for running
  programs, managing files, and controlling peripheral devices such as printers
  and disk drives. It also provided a command-line interface for users to
  interact with the system. MS-DOS was eventually replaced by Windows 95 and
  later versions of Windows.
