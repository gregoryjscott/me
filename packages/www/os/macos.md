title: macOS
desc: >-
  macOS is Apple’s Unix‐based desktop operating system, first released in 2001
  as Mac OS X and built on the open‐source Darwin core and the proprietary XNU
  kernel. Designed exclusively for Mac computers, it combines a polished Aqua
  graphical interface with deep integration of hardware and software, offering
  features like Spotlight search, Time Machine backups, and Continuity for
  seamless work across Apple devices. With strong emphasis on stability,
  security and performance, macOS supports a rich ecosystem of native and
  third-party applications via the Mac App Store and developer tools such as
  Xcode, making it a popular choice for both creative professionals and everyday
  users.
