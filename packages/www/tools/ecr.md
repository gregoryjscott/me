  Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed Docker container
  registry that makes it easy to store, manage, and deploy Docker container
  images. It is secure, highly available, and scales automatically to meet the
  needs of your applications. ECR integrates with Amazon Elastic Container
  Service (ECS) and AWS Fargate, simplifying your development to production
  workflow. It also provides features such as image scanning, lifecycle
  policies, and IAM authentication.
