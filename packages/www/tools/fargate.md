title: Fargate
desc: >-
  Fargate is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) technology that allows users to deploy
  and manage containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
  It provides a serverless compute engine for containers that eliminates the
  need to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines. Fargate
  also provides a secure and reliable platform for running containers, allowing
  users to focus on building and running their applications, rather than
  managing the underlying infrastructure.
