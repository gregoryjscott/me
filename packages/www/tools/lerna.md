  Lerna is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package
  repositories with git and npm. It allows developers to easily create,
  maintain, and version multiple packages from the same codebase. It also
  provides a powerful set of features such as managing dependencies, running
  scripts, and publishing packages. Lerna makes it easier to manage complex
  projects with multiple packages, and helps developers keep their codebase
  organized and up-to-date.
