title: React Native
desc: >-
  React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that enables
  developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript and
  React. Instead of rendering web views, React Native translates UI components
  into native platform widgets, delivering near-native performance and
  look-and-feel. Its component-based architecture and one-way data flow mirror
  React for the web, making it easy for JavaScript developers to pick up.
  Features like hot reloading accelerate the development cycle by instantly
  reflecting code changes on the device. A rich ecosystem of libraries and a
  large community contribute reusable modules and plugins, simplifying access to
  native device features (camera, geolocation, sensors) without writing
  platform-specific code. By sharing logic and UI components across platforms,
  React Native significantly reduces development time and maintenance overhead
  compared to traditional native app development.
