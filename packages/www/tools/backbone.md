title: Backbone.js
desc: >-
  Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that brings structure to
  client‐side applications by providing models with key–value binding and custom
  events, collections with rich enumerable functions, views with declarative
  event handling, and a router for managing application state and URLs. It syncs
  seamlessly with RESTful APIs via its built‐in sync method, making it easy to
  fetch and persist JSON data. By relying only on Underscore.js (and optionally
  jQuery or Zepto), Backbone.js imposes minimal constraints on how you architect
  your code while offering just enough conventions to keep large‐scale
  single‐page applications organized and maintainable. Its event‐driven design
  encourages decoupled components, and its simplicity has made it popular for
  developers who prefer to assemble their own toolchains rather than adopt more
  opinionated frameworks.
