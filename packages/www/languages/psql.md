title: PSQL
desc: >-
  PSQL (more precisely PL/pgSQL) is PostgreSQL’s built-in, block-structured
  procedural extension to SQL that lets you write server-side functions, stored
  procedures and triggers using variables, constants, composite types, control
  structures (IF, LOOP, FOR, WHILE), exception-handling and transaction control.
  It compiles into byte-code on the server, tightly integrates with standard SQL
  and PostgreSQL’s object types, and lets you encapsulate complex logic—such as
  multi-step data transformations, validation routines or business
  rules—directly in the database for improved performance, maintainability and
  security.
