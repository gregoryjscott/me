title: TI-BASIC
desc: >-
  TI-BASIC is the built-in, interpreted programming language used on Texas
  Instruments graphing calculators. It features a token‐based syntax resembling
  BASIC, with commands for arithmetic, control structures (If/Then, For, While),
  list and matrix operations, and direct access to the calculator’s display,
  menus, and graphing features. Although it’s easy to learn and deploy—making it
  popular among students for custom routines and games—its execution speed and
  memory are limited compared to compiled or desktop languages, so programmers
  often optimize code by minimizing loops, using built-in functions, or writing
  critical routines in assembly.
