title: Typescript
desc: >-
  Typescript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain
  JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to the language, allowing
  developers to use type annotations to catch errors early in the development
  process. It also provides features such as classes, modules, and interfaces
  that are not available in JavaScript. Typescript is designed to make it easier
  to write and maintain large-scale applications.
