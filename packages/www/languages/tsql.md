  Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is a proprietary procedural language used to interact
  with relational databases. It is a set-based, declarative programming language
  used to query, modify, and manage data in Microsoft SQL Server. T-SQL is used
  to create and modify database objects such as tables, views, stored
  procedures, and triggers. It also provides control of transactions and error
  handling. T-SQL is a powerful language that allows developers to write complex
  queries and stored procedures to access and manipulate data.
