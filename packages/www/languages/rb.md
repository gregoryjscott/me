  Ruby is an open-source, object-oriented programming language created by
  Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, yet
  powerful and flexible. Ruby is often used for web development, scripting, and
  general-purpose programming. It is known for its use of blocks, which allow
  for the creation of concise and powerful code. Ruby is also popular for its
  use of metaprogramming, which allows for the dynamic creation of code at
  runtime.
