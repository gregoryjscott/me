- Architected and delivered the Mission Data Loader, a mission-critical interface that all other avionics teams depended on for distributing flight plans, target coordinates, and weapon configurations.
- Ensured mission continuity during hardware failures by developing a suite of backup displays that provided full redundancy for critical input devices like keypads and switch panels.
- Functioned as a key contributor to both the Controls & Displays and the core System Management Function teams, developing the displays used to monitor the B-1's custom-built avionics operating system.
