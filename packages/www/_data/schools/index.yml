            desc: Visual Basic is a high-level, object-oriented programming language
              developed by Microsoft. It is used to create Windows applications,
              web applications, and other software. Visual Basic is a powerful
              language that allows developers to quickly create applications
              with a graphical user interface (GUI). It is easy to learn and
              use, and provides a wide range of features and capabilities.
              Visual Basic is also compatible with other programming languages,
              such as C# and Java.

            desc: C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed
              by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985. It is an extension of the C language
              and provides features such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism,
              templates, and exception handling. C++ is used to develop a wide
              range of applications, from system software to high-performance
              server and client applications, and is one of the most popular
              programming languages in the world.

          - title: C
            desc: C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed in the
              early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It is a low-level language, meaning
              it can be used to control hardware and memory, and is often used
              for system programming. C is a compiled language, meaning that it
              is converted into machine code before being executed. It is also a
              structured language, meaning that it is organized into functions,
              which can be called from other parts of the program. C is widely
              used in many applications, including operating systems, embedded
              systems, and scientific computing.

          - title: Pascal
            desc: Pascal is a procedural programming language developed in the late 1960s by
              Niklaus Wirth. It is a high-level language, meaning it is designed
              to be easier to read and write than low-level languages like
              assembly. Pascal is a strongly typed language, meaning that all
              variables must be declared with a specific type before they can be
              used. It is also a structured language, meaning that programs are
              broken down into smaller, manageable parts. Pascal is widely used
              in education and is the basis for many other languages, such as
              Object Pascal and Delphi.

          - title: FORTRAN
            desc: FORTRAN (Formula Translator) is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative
              programming language that is especially suited to numeric
              computation and scientific computing. It is a compiled language,
              meaning that it is processed by a compiler program before being
              run on a computer. It is one of the oldest programming languages
              and is still used today for a variety of applications. It is known
              for its efficiency and accuracy in numerical calculations, and is
              often used in scientific and engineering applications.

              interface, allowing users to interact with their computer using a
              mouse and keyboard. It also includes a range of applications, such
              as web browsers, media players, and office suites. Windows also
              includes a range of security features, such as user accounts,
              firewalls, and antivirus software.

            desc: MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) is an operating system developed
              by Microsoft for IBM-compatible personal computers. It was the
              most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems
              and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal
              computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s. MS-DOS was
              designed to provide a user-friendly environment for running
              programs, managing files, and controlling peripheral devices such
              as printers and disk drives. It also provided a command-line
              interface for users to interact with the system. MS-DOS was
              eventually replaced by Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.
