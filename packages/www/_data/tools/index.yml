    - title: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
      desc: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a cloud computing service that
        provides users with a virtual private cloud, allowing them to provision
        a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It
        provides users with complete control over their virtual networking
        environment, including selection of their own IP address range, creation
        of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. It
        also provides users with the ability to securely connect their VPC to
        their existing IT infrastructure using industry-standard encrypted IPsec
        VPN connections.

    - title: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
      desc: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing
        service that enables applications to quickly and reliably queue messages
        that one component of an application can later process. SQS eliminates
        the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating
        message-oriented middleware, and provides a simple and cost-effective
        way to decouple the components of an application. SQS offers a reliable,
        highly-scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel
        between computers. It also provides a simple web services interface that
        can be used to access queues, add, receive, and delete messages.

      desc: SikuliX is an open-source GUI automation tool that uses image recognition
        to interact with on-screen elements by matching screenshots. It lets you
        write scripts in Python (via Jython), Java, and other JVM languages to
        click, type, and verify UI states without needing native application
        hooks. Built on OpenCV, SikuliX works across Windows, macOS, and Linux,
        making it ideal for automating legacy or custom interfaces and
        integrating with testing frameworks for end-to-end automation or
        repetitive desktop task scripting.

      desc: Puppeteer is a Node library developed by Google that provides a high-level
        API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.
        It can be used to automate tasks that would normally be performed

        input, or capturing a timeline trace to diagnose performance issues.
        Puppeteer can also be used to generate screenshots and PDFs of web
        pages.

    - title: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      desc: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you
        securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can create and
        manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their
        access to AWS resources. IAM also enables you to create and manage
        security credentials such as access keys, passwords, and multi-factor
        authentication devices. You can use IAM to manage access to AWS services
        such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS.
