    - title: Jekyll
      desc: Jekyll is an open-source, Ruby-based static site generator that transforms
        plain-text content (written in Markdown, Textile or HTML) and
        Liquid-templated layouts into a complete, static website. By using
        simple “front matter” at the top of each page or post to define metadata
        (like title, date and categories), Jekyll assembles content with shared
        layouts, includes and assets into fully rendered HTML files. Because it
        produces only static pages—no databases or server-side processing—it
        delivers fast, secure sites that are easy to host (notably on GitHub
        Pages) and maintain via version control.

      desc: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a cloud computing service that
        provides users with a virtual private cloud, allowing them to provision
        a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It
        provides users with complete control over their virtual networking
        environment, including selection of their own IP address range, creation
        of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. It
        also provides users with the ability to securely connect their VPC to
        their existing IT infrastructure using industry-standard encrypted IPsec
        VPN connections.

    - title: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
      desc: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing
        service that enables applications to quickly and reliably queue messages
        that one component of an application can later process. SQS eliminates
        the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating
        message-oriented middleware, and provides a simple and cost-effective
        way to decouple the components of an application. SQS offers a reliable,
        highly-scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel
        between computers. It also provides a simple web services interface that
        can be used to access queues, add, receive, and delete messages.

      desc: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you
        securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can create and
        manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their
        access to AWS resources. IAM also enables you to create and manage
        security credentials such as access keys, passwords, and multi-factor
        authentication devices. You can use IAM to manage access to AWS services
        such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS.

      subtitle: Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a a media type for
        representing resources with hyperlinks
      desc: The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple, vendor-neutral media
        type for representing resources and their relationships in JSON or XML,
        designed to make RESTful APIs more discoverable and self-descriptive. In
        HAL, each resource’s state is represented by its attributes, its
        hyperlinks by a standardized “_links” section (allowing clients to
        navigate between related resources), and any embedded sub‐resources by
        an “_embedded” section. By providing a consistent convention for linking
        and embedding, HAL enables clients to follow HATEOAS
        principles—dynamically discovering available operations and
        transitions—without relying on out-of-band documentation.

      desc: Fargate is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) technology that allows users to
        deploy and manage containers without having to manage the underlying
        infrastructure. It provides a serverless compute engine for containers
        that eliminates the need to provision, configure, and scale clusters of
        virtual machines. Fargate also provides a secure and reliable platform
        for running containers, allowing users to focus on building and running
        their applications, rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.

      desc: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides secure,
        resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make
        web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. EC2 allows users to
        launch virtual servers, called “instances”, which can be configured to
        their specific needs. EC2 also provides users with the ability to scale
        their computing resources up or down as needed, allowing them to pay
        only for the resources they use.

        states, runtime interpreters, visualizers, and integrations for React,
        Vue, Angular, and Node.js, XState delivers predictable, testable, and
        maintainable state management for complex synchronous and asynchronous
        workflows.

        to interact with on-screen elements by matching screenshots. It lets you
        write scripts in Python (via Jython), Java, and other JVM languages to
        click, type, and verify UI states without needing native application
        hooks. Built on OpenCV, SikuliX works across Windows, macOS, and Linux,
        making it ideal for automating legacy or custom interfaces and
        integrating with testing frameworks for end-to-end automation or
        repetitive desktop task scripting.

    - title: React Native
      desc: React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that
        enables developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using
        JavaScript and React. Instead of rendering web views, React Native
        translates UI components into native platform widgets, delivering
        near-native performance and look-and-feel. Its component-based
        architecture and one-way data flow mirror React for the web, making it
        easy for JavaScript developers to pick up. Features like hot reloading
        accelerate the development cycle by instantly reflecting code changes on
        the device. A rich ecosystem of libraries and a large community
        contribute reusable modules and plugins, simplifying access to native
        device features (camera, geolocation, sensors) without writing
        platform-specific code. By sharing logic and UI components across
        platforms, React Native significantly reduces development time and
        maintenance overhead compared to traditional native app development.

        API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.
        It can be used to automate tasks that would normally be performed
        manually in the browser, such as form submission, UI testing, keyboard
        input, or capturing a timeline trace to diagnose performance issues.
        Puppeteer can also be used to generate screenshots and PDFs of web
        pages.

      desc: Heroku is a cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies the
        deployment, management and scaling of modern web applications.
        Developers push code to Heroku via Git or GitHub, and Heroku’s
        buildpacks automatically detect the language (such as Ruby, Node.js,
        Python, Java, Go or PHP), install dependencies and compile a runnable
        slug. Applications run in lightweight, isolated containers called dynos,
        which can be scaled horizontally or vertically on demand. The platform
        also offers a marketplace of add-ons (databases, caching, monitoring,
        logging, etc.), a web-based dashboard and a command-line interface,
        allowing teams to iterate quickly without managing underlying
        infrastructure.

    - title: Backbone.js
      desc: Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that brings structure to
        client‐side applications by providing models with key–value binding and
        custom events, collections with rich enumerable functions, views with
        declarative event handling, and a router for managing application state
        and URLs. It syncs seamlessly with RESTful APIs via its built‐in sync
        method, making it easy to fetch and persist JSON data. By relying only
        on Underscore.js (and optionally jQuery or Zepto), Backbone.js imposes
        minimal constraints on how you architect your code while offering just
        enough conventions to keep large‐scale single‐page applications
        organized and maintainable. Its event‐driven design encourages decoupled
        components, and its simplicity has made it popular for developers who
        prefer to assemble their own toolchains rather than adopt more
        opinionated frameworks.

      desc: AWS Amplify is a comprehensive development platform from Amazon Web
        Services that enables developers to quickly build, deploy, and manage
        scalable full-stack web and mobile applications. It provides a set of
        libraries, UI components and a command-line interface for integrating
        popular front-end frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, iOS, Android,
        Flutter) with cloud backends, including authentication, GraphQL and REST
        APIs, storage, and serverless functions. Amplify Studio offers a visual
        development environment for designing UI and data models, while built-in
        hosting, CI/CD and environment management streamline the application
        lifecycle so teams can focus on features instead of infrastructure.
