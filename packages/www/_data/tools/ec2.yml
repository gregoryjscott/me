title: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
desc: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides secure,
  resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale
  cloud computing easier for developers. EC2 allows users to launch virtual
  servers, called “instances”, which can be configured to their specific needs.
  EC2 also provides users with the ability to scale their computing resources up
  or down as needed, allowing them to pay only for the resources they use.
