title: React Native
desc: React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that
  enables developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript
  and React. Instead of rendering web views, React Native translates UI
  components into native platform widgets, delivering near-native performance
  and look-and-feel. Its component-based architecture and one-way data flow
  mirror React for the web, making it easy for JavaScript developers to pick up.
  Features like hot reloading accelerate the development cycle by instantly
  reflecting code changes on the device. A rich ecosystem of libraries and a
  large community contribute reusable modules and plugins, simplifying access to
  native device features (camera, geolocation, sensors) without writing
  platform-specific code. By sharing logic and UI components across platforms,
  React Native significantly reduces development time and maintenance overhead
  compared to traditional native app development.
