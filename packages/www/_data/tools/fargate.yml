title: Fargate
desc: Fargate is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) technology that allows users to
  deploy and manage containers without having to manage the underlying
  infrastructure. It provides a serverless compute engine for containers that
  eliminates the need to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual
  machines. Fargate also provides a secure and reliable platform for running
  containers, allowing users to focus on building and running their
  applications, rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.
