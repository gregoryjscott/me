title: Heroku
desc: Heroku is a cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies the
  deployment, management and scaling of modern web applications. Developers push
  code to Heroku via Git or GitHub, and Herokuâ€™s buildpacks automatically detect
  the language (such as Ruby, Node.js, Python, Java, Go or PHP), install
  dependencies and compile a runnable slug. Applications run in lightweight,
  isolated containers called dynos, which can be scaled horizontally or
  vertically on demand. The platform also offers a marketplace of add-ons
  (databases, caching, monitoring, logging, etc.), a web-based dashboard and a
  command-line interface, allowing teams to iterate quickly without managing
  underlying infrastructure.
