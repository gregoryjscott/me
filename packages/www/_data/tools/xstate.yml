title: XState
desc: XState is a JavaScript/TypeScript library for modeling application logic
  as finite state machines and hierarchical statecharts, enabling developers to
  define states, transitions, guards, actions, and invoked services
  declaratively. With built-in support for parallel and history states, runtime
  interpreters, visualizers, and integrations for React, Vue, Angular, and
  Node.js, XState delivers predictable, testable, and maintainable state
  management for complex synchronous and asynchronous workflows.
