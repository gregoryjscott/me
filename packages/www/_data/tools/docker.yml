title: Docker
desc: Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running
  applications. It uses container technology to package applications into
  isolated, lightweight, and portable containers that can be quickly deployed
  and moved between different computing environments. Docker also provides a set
  of tools and services to help developers build, ship, and run applications in
  a more efficient and secure way.
