title: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
desc: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a cloud computing service that
  provides users with a virtual private cloud, allowing them to provision a
  logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It provides
  users with complete control over their virtual networking environment,
  including selection of their own IP address range, creation of subnets, and
  configuration of route tables and network gateways. It also provides users
  with the ability to securely connect their VPC to their existing IT
  infrastructure using industry-standard encrypted IPsec VPN connections.
