title: Expo
desc: Expo is an open-source platform and toolchain built around React Native
  that lets developers write modern JavaScript or TypeScript to produce fully
  native iOS, Android and web apps without configuring Xcode or Android Studio.
  It provides a comprehensive SDK of prebuilt, cross-platform APIs (camera,
  sensors, notifications, maps, file system, etc.), a command-line interface for
  project scaffolding and local testing, and cloud services for building
  binaries, over-the-air updates, push-notification delivery and app store
  publishing. By abstracting away much of the native configuration—while still
  allowing “ejecting” to integrate custom native modules—Expo accelerates
  development, simplifies maintenance and lowers the barrier to entry for
  mobile-first teams.
