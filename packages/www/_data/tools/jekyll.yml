title: Jekyll
desc: Jekyll is an open-source, Ruby-based static site generator that transforms
  plain-text content (written in Markdown, Textile or HTML) and Liquid-templated
  layouts into a complete, static website. By using simple “front matter” at the
  top of each page or post to define metadata (like title, date and categories),
  Jekyll assembles content with shared layouts, includes and assets into fully
  rendered HTML files. Because it produces only static pages—no databases or
  server-side processing—it delivers fast, secure sites that are easy to host
  (notably on GitHub Pages) and maintain via version control.
