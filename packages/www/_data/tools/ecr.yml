title: ECR
desc: Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed Docker
  container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, and deploy Docker
  container images. It is secure, highly available, and scales automatically to
  meet the needs of your applications. ECR integrates with Amazon Elastic
  Container Service (ECS) and AWS Fargate, simplifying your development to
  production workflow. It also provides features such as image scanning,
  lifecycle policies, and IAM authentication.
