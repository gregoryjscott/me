title: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
desc: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you
  securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can create and manage
  AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to
  AWS resources. IAM also enables you to create and manage security credentials
  such as access keys, passwords, and multi-factor authentication devices. You
  can use IAM to manage access to AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3,
  and Amazon RDS.
