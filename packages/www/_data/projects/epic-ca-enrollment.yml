    - title: PHP
      desc: PHP is a server-side scripting language used for web development. It is a
        powerful language that is used to create dynamic web pages and
        applications. It is an open-source language, meaning it is free to use
        and modify. PHP is easy to learn and is widely used for creating
        websites and web applications. It is also used to create database-driven
        websites and applications.

    - title: Firebase
      desc: Firebase’s Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL JSON data store that
        lets you build rich, collaborative applications by syncing data in
        milliseconds across all connected clients. Data is stored as a single,
        hierarchical JSON tree and updated in real time—any changes made by one
        client are immediately pushed to every other. SDKs for iOS, Android and
        web handle offline caching and automatic resynchronization, while
        granular security rules and Firebase Authentication ensure data is
        accessed and modified only by authorized users. With built-in
        scalability, sharding and integration with other Firebase services
        (Cloud Functions, Analytics, etc.), the Realtime Database simplifies the
        creation of responsive, data-driven apps without the need to manage your
        own backend.
