    - title: CSS
      desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
        the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
        HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
        content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
        improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
        .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
        content.
