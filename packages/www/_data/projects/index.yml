              allowing developers to use type annotations to catch errors early
              in the development process. It also provides features such as
              classes, modules, and interfaces that are not available in
              JavaScript. Typescript is designed to make it easier to write and
              maintain large-scale applications.

            desc: Ruby is an open-source, object-oriented programming language created by
              Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995. It is designed to be simple and easy
              to use, yet powerful and flexible. Ruby is often used for web
              development, scripting, and general-purpose programming. It is
              known for its use of blocks, which allow for the creation of
              concise and powerful code. Ruby is also popular for its use of
              metaprogramming, which allows for the dynamic creation of code at
              runtime.

              webpages and web applications. It is the standard markup language
              used to create webpages and web applications. HTML is written in
              the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle
              brackets. These tags describe the content and structure of
              webpages and web applications. HTML also provides a means to
              create interactive webpages and web applications with the use of
              HTML forms, which can be used to collect user input.

            desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
              the presentation of a document written in a markup language such
              as HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation
              and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation
              can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
              repetition in the structural content.

              development, scripting, and general-purpose programming. It is
              known for its use of blocks, which allow for the creation of
              concise and powerful code. Ruby is also popular for its use of
              metaprogramming, which allows for the dynamic creation of code at
              runtime.

              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the

              and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation
              can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
              repetition in the structural content.

            desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
              the presentation of a document written in a markup language such
              as HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation
              and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation
              can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
              repetition in the structural content.

            desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
              the presentation of a document written in a markup language such
              as HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation
              and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation
              can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
              repetition in the structural content.

              known for its use of blocks, which allow for the creation of
              concise and powerful code. Ruby is also popular for its use of
              metaprogramming, which allows for the dynamic creation of code at
              runtime.

              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the

              can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
              repetition in the structural content.

              to manipulate data in an Oracle database. PL/SQL code can be used
              to create stored procedures, functions, packages, and triggers, as
              well as to execute SQL statements. PL/SQL is a powerful language
              that allows developers to create complex applications and to
              interact with the Oracle database.

              and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation
              can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
              repetition in the structural content.
