  languages:
    - title: Ruby
      desc: Ruby is an open-source, object-oriented programming language created by
        Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995. It is designed to be simple and easy to use,
        yet powerful and flexible. Ruby is often used for web development,
        scripting, and general-purpose programming. It is known for its use of
        blocks, which allow for the creation of concise and powerful code. Ruby
        is also popular for its use of metaprogramming, which allows for the
        dynamic creation of code at runtime.

    - title: Jekyll
      desc: Jekyll is an open-source, Ruby-based static site generator that transforms
        plain-text content (written in Markdown, Textile or HTML) and
        Liquid-templated layouts into a complete, static website. By using
        simple “front matter” at the top of each page or post to define metadata
        (like title, date and categories), Jekyll assembles content with shared
        layouts, includes and assets into fully rendered HTML files. Because it
        produces only static pages—no databases or server-side processing—it
        delivers fast, secure sites that are easy to host (notably on GitHub
        Pages) and maintain via version control.

    - title: Heroku
      desc: Heroku is a cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies the
        deployment, management and scaling of modern web applications.
        Developers push code to Heroku via Git or GitHub, and Heroku’s
        buildpacks automatically detect the language (such as Ruby, Node.js,
        Python, Java, Go or PHP), install dependencies and compile a runnable
        slug. Applications run in lightweight, isolated containers called dynos,
        which can be scaled horizontally or vertically on demand. The platform
        also offers a marketplace of add-ons (databases, caching, monitoring,
        logging, etc.), a web-based dashboard and a command-line interface,
        allowing teams to iterate quickly without managing underlying
        infrastructure.

    - title: Linux
      desc: Linux is an open-source operating system that is based on the Linux
        kernel. It is a free and powerful operating system that is used in many
        different types of computing devices, from smartphones to
        supercomputers. It is highly customizable and can be used for a variety
        of tasks, from web hosting to software development. It is also highly
        secure and reliable, making it a popular choice for many users.
