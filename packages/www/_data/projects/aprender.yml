    - title: macOS
      desc: macOS is Apple’s Unix‐based desktop operating system, first released in
        2001 as Mac OS X and built on the open‐source Darwin core and the
        proprietary XNU kernel. Designed exclusively for Mac computers, it
        combines a polished Aqua graphical interface with deep integration of
        hardware and software, offering features like Spotlight search, Time
        Machine backups, and Continuity for seamless work across Apple devices.
        With strong emphasis on stability, security and performance, macOS
        supports a rich ecosystem of native and third-party applications via the
        Mac App Store and developer tools such as Xcode, making it a popular
        choice for both creative professionals and everyday users.
