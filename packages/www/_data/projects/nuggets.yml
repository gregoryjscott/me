      desc: Typescript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain
        JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to the language, allowing
        developers to use type annotations to catch errors early in the
        development process. It also provides features such as classes, modules,
        and interfaces that are not available in JavaScript. Typescript is
        designed to make it easier to write and maintain large-scale
        applications.

    - title: Expo
      desc: Expo is an open-source platform and toolchain built around React Native
        that lets developers write modern JavaScript or TypeScript to produce
        fully native iOS, Android and web apps without configuring Xcode or
        Android Studio. It provides a comprehensive SDK of prebuilt,
        cross-platform APIs (camera, sensors, notifications, maps, file system,
        etc.), a command-line interface for project scaffolding and local
        testing, and cloud services for building binaries, over-the-air updates,
        push-notification delivery and app store publishing. By abstracting away
        much of the native configuration—while still allowing “ejecting” to
        integrate custom native modules—Expo accelerates development, simplifies
        maintenance and lowers the barrier to entry for mobile-first teams.

        deploy and manage containers without having to manage the underlying
        infrastructure. It provides a serverless compute engine for containers
        that eliminates the need to provision, configure, and scale clusters of
        virtual machines. Fargate also provides a secure and reliable platform
        for running containers, allowing users to focus on building and running
        their applications, rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.

        manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their
        access to AWS resources. IAM also enables you to create and manage
        security credentials such as access keys, passwords, and multi-factor
        authentication devices. You can use IAM to manage access to AWS services
        such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS.

    - title: React Native
      desc: React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that
        enables developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using
        JavaScript and React. Instead of rendering web views, React Native
        translates UI components into native platform widgets, delivering
        near-native performance and look-and-feel. Its component-based
        architecture and one-way data flow mirror React for the web, making it
        easy for JavaScript developers to pick up. Features like hot reloading
        accelerate the development cycle by instantly reflecting code changes on
        the device. A rich ecosystem of libraries and a large community
        contribute reusable modules and plugins, simplifying access to native
        device features (camera, geolocation, sensors) without writing
        platform-specific code. By sharing logic and UI components across
        platforms, React Native significantly reduces development time and
        maintenance overhead compared to traditional native app development.

        Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides object storage through a web
        service interface and is designed to store and retrieve any amount of
        data from anywhere on the web. It is highly scalable, secure, and
        durable, and provides features such as data versioning, encryption, and
        access control. S3 is used by many organizations for storing and backing
        up data, hosting websites, and streaming media.

      desc: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing
        service that enables applications to quickly and reliably queue messages
        that one component of an application can later process. SQS eliminates
        the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating
        message-oriented middleware, and provides a simple and cost-effective
        way to decouple the components of an application. SQS offers a reliable,
        highly-scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel
        between computers. It also provides a simple web services interface that
        can be used to access queues, add, receive, and delete messages.

        provides users with a virtual private cloud, allowing them to provision
        a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It
        provides users with complete control over their virtual networking
        environment, including selection of their own IP address range, creation
        of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. It
        also provides users with the ability to securely connect their VPC to
        their existing IT infrastructure using industry-standard encrypted IPsec
        VPN connections.
