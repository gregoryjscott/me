    - title: CSS
      desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
        the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
        HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
        content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
        improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
        .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
        content.

        declarative event handling, and a router for managing application state
        and URLs. It syncs seamlessly with RESTful APIs via its built‐in sync
        method, making it easy to fetch and persist JSON data. By relying only
        on Underscore.js (and optionally jQuery or Zepto), Backbone.js imposes
        minimal constraints on how you architect your code while offering just
        enough conventions to keep large‐scale single‐page applications
        organized and maintainable. Its event‐driven design encourages decoupled
        components, and its simplicity has made it popular for developers who
        prefer to assemble their own toolchains rather than adopt more
        opinionated frameworks.
