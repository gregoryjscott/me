        warehousing, e-commerce, web applications, and more. It supports a wide
        range of data types, including JSON, XML, and user-defined types. It
        also provides powerful features such as triggers, stored procedures, and
        views. Postgres is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data.
        It is also highly secure, with built-in authentication and access
        control.

        webpages and web applications. It is the standard markup language used
        to create webpages and web applications. HTML is written in the form of
        HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets. These tags
        describe the content and structure of webpages and web applications.
        HTML also provides a means to create interactive webpages and web
        applications with the use of HTML forms, which can be used to collect
        user input.

      desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
        the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
        HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
        content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
        improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
        .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
        content.

        management system (RDBMS). It is used to perform tasks such as
        retrieving, updating, inserting, and deleting data from a database. SQL
        is also used to create and modify database structures, such as tables,
        views, and stored procedures. It is a powerful language that can be used
        to query, analyze, and manipulate data.

        blocks, which allow for the creation of concise and powerful code. Ruby
        is also popular for its use of metaprogramming, which allows for the
        dynamic creation of code at runtime.

      subtitle: Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a a media type for
        representing resources with hyperlinks
      desc: The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple, vendor-neutral media
        type for representing resources and their relationships in JSON or XML,
        designed to make RESTful APIs more discoverable and self-descriptive. In
        HAL, each resource’s state is represented by its attributes, its
        hyperlinks by a standardized “_links” section (allowing clients to
        navigate between related resources), and any embedded sub‐resources by
        an “_embedded” section. By providing a consistent convention for linking
        and embedding, HAL enables clients to follow HATEOAS
        principles—dynamically discovering available operations and
        transitions—without relying on out-of-band documentation.

      desc: Jekyll is an open-source, Ruby-based static site generator that transforms
        plain-text content (written in Markdown, Textile or HTML) and
        Liquid-templated layouts into a complete, static website. By using
        simple “front matter” at the top of each page or post to define metadata
        (like title, date and categories), Jekyll assembles content with shared
        layouts, includes and assets into fully rendered HTML files. Because it
        produces only static pages—no databases or server-side processing—it
        delivers fast, secure sites that are easy to host (notably on GitHub
        Pages) and maintain via version control.

        deployment, management and scaling of modern web applications.
        Developers push code to Heroku via Git or GitHub, and Heroku’s
        buildpacks automatically detect the language (such as Ruby, Node.js,
        Python, Java, Go or PHP), install dependencies and compile a runnable
        slug. Applications run in lightweight, isolated containers called dynos,
        which can be scaled horizontally or vertically on demand. The platform
        also offers a marketplace of add-ons (databases, caching, monitoring,
        logging, etc.), a web-based dashboard and a command-line interface,
        allowing teams to iterate quickly without managing underlying
        infrastructure.
