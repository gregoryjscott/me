      desc: Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. It is based on a
        modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, and
        is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones
        and tablets. Android has a large community of developers writing
        applications ("apps") that extend the functionality of the devices. Apps
        can be downloaded from third-party app stores or through online stores
        such as Google Play. Android has been the best-selling OS on tablets
        since 2013, and on smartphones it is dominant by any metric.

        user-friendly environment for running programs, managing files, and
        controlling peripheral devices such as printers and disk drives. It also
        provided a command-line interface for users to interact with the system.
        MS-DOS was eventually replaced by Windows 95 and later versions of
        Windows.
