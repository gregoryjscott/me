title: CSS
desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
  the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS
  is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including
  layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility,
  provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
  characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
  the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition
  in the structural content.
