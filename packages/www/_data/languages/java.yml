title: Java
desc: Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed
  by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is designed to be platform-independent,
  meaning that code written in Java can run on any platform that supports the
  Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is used for developing a wide range of
  applications, from web applications to mobile applications and enterprise
  applications. It is also used for developing embedded systems and games. Java
  is a statically typed language, meaning that variables must be declared before
  they can be used. It also supports garbage collection, which helps to manage
  memory usage.
