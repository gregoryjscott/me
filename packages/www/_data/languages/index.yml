    - title: Typescript
      desc: Typescript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain
        JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to the language, allowing
        developers to use type annotations to catch errors early in the
        development process. It also provides features such as classes, modules,
        and interfaces that are not available in JavaScript. Typescript is
        designed to make it easier to write and maintain large-scale
        applications.

    - title: Ruby
      desc: Ruby is an open-source, object-oriented programming language created by
        Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995. It is designed to be simple and easy to use,
        yet powerful and flexible. Ruby is often used for web development,
        scripting, and general-purpose programming. It is known for its use of
        blocks, which allow for the creation of concise and powerful code. Ruby
        is also popular for its use of metaprogramming, which allows for the
        dynamic creation of code at runtime.

    - title: HTML
      desc: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to create
        webpages and web applications. It is the standard markup language used
        to create webpages and web applications. HTML is written in the form of
        HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets. These tags
        describe the content and structure of webpages and web applications.
        HTML also provides a means to create interactive webpages and web
        applications with the use of HTML forms, which can be used to collect
        user input.

      desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
        the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
        HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
        content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
        improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
        .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
        content.

      desc: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in
        programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database
        management system (RDBMS). It is used to perform tasks such as
        retrieving, updating, inserting, and deleting data from a database. SQL
        is also used to create and modify database structures, such as tables,
        views, and stored procedures. It is a powerful language that can be used
        to query, analyze, and manipulate data.

        with relational databases. It is a set-based, declarative programming
        language used to query, modify, and manage data in Microsoft SQL Server.
        T-SQL is used to create and modify database objects such as tables,
        views, stored procedures, and triggers. It also provides control of
        transactions and error handling. T-SQL is a powerful language that
        allows developers to write complex queries and stored procedures to
        access and manipulate data.

      desc: PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is a procedural
        language used in Oracle databases. It is a combination of SQL and
        procedural programming language, allowing developers to write code to
        manipulate data in an Oracle database. PL/SQL code can be used to create
        stored procedures, functions, packages, and triggers, as well as to
        execute SQL statements. PL/SQL is a powerful language that allows
        developers to create complex applications and to interact with the
        Oracle database.

      desc: Pascal is a procedural programming language developed in the late 1960s by
        Niklaus Wirth. It is a high-level language, meaning it is designed to be
        easier to read and write than low-level languages like assembly. Pascal
        is a strongly typed language, meaning that all variables must be
        declared with a specific type before they can be used. It is also a
        structured language, meaning that programs are broken down into smaller,
        manageable parts. Pascal is widely used in education and is the basis
        for many other languages, such as Object Pascal and Delphi.

        programming. C is a compiled language, meaning that it is converted into
        machine code before being executed. It is also a structured language,
        meaning that it is organized into functions, which can be called from
        other parts of the program. C is widely used in many applications,
        including operating systems, embedded systems, and scientific computing.
