title: PL/SQL
desc: PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is a procedural
  language used in Oracle databases. It is a combination of SQL and procedural
  programming language, allowing developers to write code to manipulate data in
  an Oracle database. PL/SQL code can be used to create stored procedures,
  functions, packages, and triggers, as well as to execute SQL statements.
  PL/SQL is a powerful language that allows developers to create complex
  applications and to interact with the Oracle database.
