          - title: Expo
            desc: Expo is an open-source platform and toolchain built around React Native
              that lets developers write modern JavaScript or TypeScript to
              produce fully native iOS, Android and web apps without configuring
              Xcode or Android Studio. It provides a comprehensive SDK of
              prebuilt, cross-platform APIs (camera, sensors, notifications,
              maps, file system, etc.), a command-line interface for project
              scaffolding and local testing, and cloud services for building
              binaries, over-the-air updates, push-notification delivery and app
              store publishing. By abstracting away much of the native
              configuration—while still allowing “ejecting” to integrate custom
              native modules—Expo accelerates development, simplifies
              maintenance and lowers the barrier to entry for mobile-first
              teams.

              for containers that eliminates the need to provision, configure,
              and scale clusters of virtual machines. Fargate also provides a
              secure and reliable platform for running containers, allowing
              users to focus on building and running their applications, rather
              than managing the underlying infrastructure.

          - title: React Native
            desc: React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that
              enables developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using
              JavaScript and React. Instead of rendering web views, React Native
              translates UI components into native platform widgets, delivering
              near-native performance and look-and-feel. Its component-based
              architecture and one-way data flow mirror React for the web,
              making it easy for JavaScript developers to pick up. Features like
              hot reloading accelerate the development cycle by instantly
              reflecting code changes on the device. A rich ecosystem of
              libraries and a large community contribute reusable modules and
              plugins, simplifying access to native device features (camera,
              geolocation, sensors) without writing platform-specific code. By
              sharing logic and UI components across platforms, React Native
              significantly reduces development time and maintenance overhead
              compared to traditional native app development.

            desc: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing
              service that enables applications to quickly and reliably queue
              messages that one component of an application can later process.
              SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with
              managing and operating message-oriented middleware, and provides a
              simple and cost-effective way to decouple the components of an
              application. SQS offers a reliable, highly-scalable, hosted queue
              for storing messages as they travel between computers. It also
              provides a simple web services interface that can be used to
              access queues, add, receive, and delete messages.

          - title: CSS
            desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
              the presentation of a document written in a markup language such
              as HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation
              and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation
              can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
              repetition in the structural content.

          - title: Backbone.js
            desc: Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that brings structure to
              client‐side applications by providing models with key–value
              binding and custom events, collections with rich enumerable
              functions, views with declarative event handling, and a router for
              managing application state and URLs. It syncs seamlessly with
              RESTful APIs via its built‐in sync method, making it easy to fetch
              and persist JSON data. By relying only on Underscore.js (and
              optionally jQuery or Zepto), Backbone.js imposes minimal
              constraints on how you architect your code while offering just
              enough conventions to keep large‐scale single‐page applications
              organized and maintainable. Its event‐driven design encourages
              decoupled components, and its simplicity has made it popular for
              developers who prefer to assemble their own toolchains rather than
              adopt more opinionated frameworks.

        programming. C is a compiled language, meaning that it is converted into
        machine code before being executed. It is also a structured language,
        meaning that it is organized into functions, which can be called from
        other parts of the program. C is widely used in many applications,
        including operating systems, embedded systems, and scientific computing.

      desc: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
        the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
        HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
        content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
        improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
        .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
        content.

    - title: Pascal
      desc: Pascal is a procedural programming language developed in the late 1960s by
        Niklaus Wirth. It is a high-level language, meaning it is designed to be
        easier to read and write than low-level languages like assembly. Pascal
        is a strongly typed language, meaning that all variables must be
        declared with a specific type before they can be used. It is also a
        structured language, meaning that programs are broken down into smaller,
        manageable parts. Pascal is widely used in education and is the basis
        for many other languages, such as Object Pascal and Delphi.

      desc: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in
        programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database
        management system (RDBMS). It is used to perform tasks such as
        retrieving, updating, inserting, and deleting data from a database. SQL
        is also used to create and modify database structures, such as tables,
        views, and stored procedures. It is a powerful language that can be used
        to query, analyze, and manipulate data.

      desc: TI-BASIC is the built-in, interpreted programming language used on Texas
        Instruments graphing calculators. It features a token‐based syntax
        resembling BASIC, with commands for arithmetic, control structures
        (If/Then, For, While), list and matrix operations, and direct access to
        the calculator’s display, menus, and graphing features. Although it’s
        easy to learn and deploy—making it popular among students for custom
        routines and games—its execution speed and memory are limited compared
        to compiled or desktop languages, so programmers often optimize code by
        minimizing loops, using built-in functions, or writing critical routines
        in assembly.

      desc: Typescript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain
        JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to the language, allowing
        developers to use type annotations to catch errors early in the
        development process. It also provides features such as classes, modules,
        and interfaces that are not available in JavaScript. Typescript is
        designed to make it easier to write and maintain large-scale
        applications.

    - title: Firebase
      desc: Firebase’s Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL JSON data store that
        lets you build rich, collaborative applications by syncing data in
        milliseconds across all connected clients. Data is stored as a single,
        hierarchical JSON tree and updated in real time—any changes made by one
        client are immediately pushed to every other. SDKs for iOS, Android and
        web handle offline caching and automatic resynchronization, while
        granular security rules and Firebase Authentication ensure data is
        accessed and modified only by authorized users. With built-in
        scalability, sharding and integration with other Firebase services
        (Cloud Functions, Analytics, etc.), the Realtime Database simplifies the
        creation of responsive, data-driven apps without the need to manage your
        own backend.

    - title: Backbone.js
      desc: Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that brings structure to
        client‐side applications by providing models with key–value binding and
        custom events, collections with rich enumerable functions, views with
        declarative event handling, and a router for managing application state
        and URLs. It syncs seamlessly with RESTful APIs via its built‐in sync
        method, making it easy to fetch and persist JSON data. By relying only
        on Underscore.js (and optionally jQuery or Zepto), Backbone.js imposes
        minimal constraints on how you architect your code while offering just
        enough conventions to keep large‐scale single‐page applications
        organized and maintainable. Its event‐driven design encourages decoupled
        components, and its simplicity has made it popular for developers who
        prefer to assemble their own toolchains rather than adopt more
        opinionated frameworks.

      desc: Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running
        applications. It uses container technology to package applications into
        isolated, lightweight, and portable containers that can be quickly
        deployed and moved between different computing environments. Docker also
        provides a set of tools and services to help developers build, ship, and
        run applications in a more efficient and secure way.

    - title: EC2
      desc: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides secure,
        resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make
        web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. EC2 allows users to
        launch virtual servers, called “instances”, which can be configured to
        their specific needs. EC2 also provides users with the ability to scale
        their computing resources up or down as needed, allowing them to pay
        only for the resources they use.

    - title: Expo
      desc: Expo is an open-source platform and toolchain built around React Native
        that lets developers write modern JavaScript or TypeScript to produce
        fully native iOS, Android and web apps without configuring Xcode or
        Android Studio. It provides a comprehensive SDK of prebuilt,
        cross-platform APIs (camera, sensors, notifications, maps, file system,
        etc.), a command-line interface for project scaffolding and local
        testing, and cloud services for building binaries, over-the-air updates,
        push-notification delivery and app store publishing. By abstracting away
        much of the native configuration—while still allowing “ejecting” to
        integrate custom native modules—Expo accelerates development, simplifies
        maintenance and lowers the barrier to entry for mobile-first teams.

    - title: Fargate
      desc: Fargate is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) technology that allows users to
        deploy and manage containers without having to manage the underlying
        infrastructure. It provides a serverless compute engine for containers
        that eliminates the need to provision, configure, and scale clusters of
        virtual machines. Fargate also provides a secure and reliable platform
        for running containers, allowing users to focus on building and running
        their applications, rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.

    - title: HAL
      subtitle: Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a a media type for
        representing resources with hyperlinks
      desc: The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple, vendor-neutral media
        type for representing resources and their relationships in JSON or XML,
        designed to make RESTful APIs more discoverable and self-descriptive. In
        HAL, each resource’s state is represented by its attributes, its
        hyperlinks by a standardized “_links” section (allowing clients to
        navigate between related resources), and any embedded sub‐resources by
        an “_embedded” section. By providing a consistent convention for linking
        and embedding, HAL enables clients to follow HATEOAS
        principles—dynamically discovering available operations and
        transitions—without relying on out-of-band documentation.

    - title: Heroku
      desc: Heroku is a cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies the
        deployment, management and scaling of modern web applications.
        Developers push code to Heroku via Git or GitHub, and Heroku’s
        buildpacks automatically detect the language (such as Ruby, Node.js,
        Python, Java, Go or PHP), install dependencies and compile a runnable
        slug. Applications run in lightweight, isolated containers called dynos,
        which can be scaled horizontally or vertically on demand. The platform
        also offers a marketplace of add-ons (databases, caching, monitoring,
        logging, etc.), a web-based dashboard and a command-line interface,
        allowing teams to iterate quickly without managing underlying
        infrastructure.

      desc: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you
        securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can create and
        manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their
        access to AWS resources. IAM also enables you to create and manage
        security credentials such as access keys, passwords, and multi-factor
        authentication devices. You can use IAM to manage access to AWS services
        such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS.

        layouts, includes and assets into fully rendered HTML files. Because it
        produces only static pages—no databases or server-side processing—it
        delivers fast, secure sites that are easy to host (notably on GitHub
        Pages) and maintain via version control.

    - title: Puppeteer
      desc: Puppeteer is a Node library developed by Google that provides a high-level
        API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.
        It can be used to automate tasks that would normally be performed
        manually in the browser, such as form submission, UI testing, keyboard
        input, or capturing a timeline trace to diagnose performance issues.
        Puppeteer can also be used to generate screenshots and PDFs of web
        pages.

    - title: React Native
      desc: React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that
        enables developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using
        JavaScript and React. Instead of rendering web views, React Native
        translates UI components into native platform widgets, delivering
        near-native performance and look-and-feel. Its component-based
        architecture and one-way data flow mirror React for the web, making it
        easy for JavaScript developers to pick up. Features like hot reloading
        accelerate the development cycle by instantly reflecting code changes on
        the device. A rich ecosystem of libraries and a large community
        contribute reusable modules and plugins, simplifying access to native
        device features (camera, geolocation, sensors) without writing
        platform-specific code. By sharing logic and UI components across
        platforms, React Native significantly reduces development time and
        maintenance overhead compared to traditional native app development.

    - title: SikuliX
      desc: SikuliX is an open-source GUI automation tool that uses image recognition
        to interact with on-screen elements by matching screenshots. It lets you
        write scripts in Python (via Jython), Java, and other JVM languages to
        click, type, and verify UI states without needing native application
        hooks. Built on OpenCV, SikuliX works across Windows, macOS, and Linux,
        making it ideal for automating legacy or custom interfaces and
        integrating with testing frameworks for end-to-end automation or
        repetitive desktop task scripting.

    - title: SQS
      desc: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing
        service that enables applications to quickly and reliably queue messages
        that one component of an application can later process. SQS eliminates
        the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating
        message-oriented middleware, and provides a simple and cost-effective
        way to decouple the components of an application. SQS offers a reliable,
        highly-scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel
        between computers. It also provides a simple web services interface that
        can be used to access queues, add, receive, and delete messages.

      desc: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a cloud computing service that
        provides users with a virtual private cloud, allowing them to provision
        a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It
        provides users with complete control over their virtual networking
        environment, including selection of their own IP address range, creation
        of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. It
        also provides users with the ability to securely connect their VPC to
        their existing IT infrastructure using industry-standard encrypted IPsec
        VPN connections.

      desc: macOS is Apple’s Unix‐based desktop operating system, first released in
        2001 as Mac OS X and built on the open‐source Darwin core and the
        proprietary XNU kernel. Designed exclusively for Mac computers, it
        combines a polished Aqua graphical interface with deep integration of
        hardware and software, offering features like Spotlight search, Time
        Machine backups, and Continuity for seamless work across Apple devices.
        With strong emphasis on stability, security and performance, macOS
        supports a rich ecosystem of native and third-party applications via the
        Mac App Store and developer tools such as Xcode, making it a popular
        choice for both creative professionals and everyday users.

        commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems and was the
        main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during
        the 1980s and the early 1990s. MS-DOS was designed to provide a
        user-friendly environment for running programs, managing files, and
        controlling peripheral devices such as printers and disk drives. It also
        provided a command-line interface for users to interact with the system.
        MS-DOS was eventually replaced by Windows 95 and later versions of
        Windows.

              the presentation of a document written in a markup language such

              and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation
              can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
              repetition in the structural content.

            desc: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in
              programming and designed for managing data held in a relational
              database management system (RDBMS). It is used to perform tasks
              such as retrieving, updating, inserting, and deleting data from a
              database. SQL is also used to create and modify database
              structures, such as tables, views, and stored procedures. It is a
              powerful language that can be used to query, analyze, and
              manipulate data.

              produce fully native iOS, Android and web apps without configuring
              Xcode or Android Studio. It provides a comprehensive SDK of
              prebuilt, cross-platform APIs (camera, sensors, notifications,
              maps, file system, etc.), a command-line interface for project
              scaffolding and local testing, and cloud services for building
              binaries, over-the-air updates, push-notification delivery and app
              store publishing. By abstracting away much of the native
              configuration—while still allowing “ejecting” to integrate custom
              native modules—Expo accelerates development, simplifies
              maintenance and lowers the barrier to entry for mobile-first
              teams.

            desc: The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple, vendor-neutral media
              type for representing resources and their relationships in JSON or
              XML, designed to make RESTful APIs more discoverable and
              self-descriptive. In HAL, each resource’s state is represented by
              its attributes, its hyperlinks by a standardized “_links” section
              (allowing clients to navigate between related resources), and any
              embedded sub‐resources by an “_embedded” section. By providing a
              consistent convention for linking and embedding, HAL enables
              clients to follow HATEOAS principles—dynamically discovering
              available operations and transitions—without relying on
              out-of-band documentation.

              containers called dynos, which can be scaled horizontally or
              vertically on demand. The platform also offers a marketplace of
              add-ons (databases, caching, monitoring, logging, etc.), a
              web-based dashboard and a command-line interface, allowing teams
              to iterate quickly without managing underlying infrastructure.

              plain-text content (written in Markdown, Textile or HTML) and
              Liquid-templated layouts into a complete, static website. By using
              simple “front matter” at the top of each page or post to define
              metadata (like title, date and categories), Jekyll assembles
              content with shared layouts, includes and assets into fully
              rendered HTML files. Because it produces only static pages—no
              databases or server-side processing—it delivers fast, secure sites
              that are easy to host (notably on GitHub Pages) and maintain via
              version control.

          - title: React Native
            desc: React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that
              enables developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using
              JavaScript and React. Instead of rendering web views, React Native
              translates UI components into native platform widgets, delivering
              near-native performance and look-and-feel. Its component-based
              architecture and one-way data flow mirror React for the web,
              making it easy for JavaScript developers to pick up. Features like
              hot reloading accelerate the development cycle by instantly
              reflecting code changes on the device. A rich ecosystem of
              libraries and a large community contribute reusable modules and
              plugins, simplifying access to native device features (camera,
              geolocation, sensors) without writing platform-specific code. By
              sharing logic and UI components across platforms, React Native
              significantly reduces development time and maintenance overhead
              compared to traditional native app development.

              messages that one component of an application can later process.
              SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with
              managing and operating message-oriented middleware, and provides a
              simple and cost-effective way to decouple the components of an
              application. SQS offers a reliable, highly-scalable, hosted queue
              for storing messages as they travel between computers. It also
              provides a simple web services interface that can be used to
              access queues, add, receive, and delete messages.

              single, hierarchical JSON tree and updated in real time—any
              changes made by one client are immediately pushed to every other.
              SDKs for iOS, Android and web handle offline caching and automatic
              resynchronization, while granular security rules and Firebase
              Authentication ensure data is accessed and modified only by
              authorized users. With built-in scalability, sharding and
              integration with other Firebase services (Cloud Functions,
              Analytics, etc.), the Realtime Database simplifies the creation of
              responsive, data-driven apps without the need to manage your own
              backend.

            desc: SikuliX is an open-source GUI automation tool that uses image recognition
              to interact with on-screen elements by matching screenshots. It
              lets you write scripts in Python (via Jython), Java, and other JVM
              languages to click, type, and verify UI states without needing
              native application hooks. Built on OpenCV, SikuliX works across
              Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it ideal for automating legacy
              or custom interfaces and integrating with testing frameworks for
              end-to-end automation or repetitive desktop task scripting.

          - title: SQS
            desc: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing
              service that enables applications to quickly and reliably queue
              messages that one component of an application can later process.
              SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with
              managing and operating message-oriented middleware, and provides a
              simple and cost-effective way to decouple the components of an
              application. SQS offers a reliable, highly-scalable, hosted queue
              for storing messages as they travel between computers. It also
              provides a simple web services interface that can be used to
              access queues, add, receive, and delete messages.

              tables and network gateways. It also provides users with the
              ability to securely connect their VPC to their existing IT
              infrastructure using industry-standard encrypted IPsec VPN
              connections.

              and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation
              can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
              repetition in the structural content.

            desc: Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that brings structure to
              client‐side applications by providing models with key–value
              binding and custom events, collections with rich enumerable
              functions, views with declarative event handling, and a router for
              managing application state and URLs. It syncs seamlessly with
              RESTful APIs via its built‐in sync method, making it easy to fetch
              and persist JSON data. By relying only on Underscore.js (and
              optionally jQuery or Zepto), Backbone.js imposes minimal
              constraints on how you architect your code while offering just
              enough conventions to keep large‐scale single‐page applications
              organized and maintainable. Its event‐driven design encourages
              decoupled components, and its simplicity has made it popular for
              developers who prefer to assemble their own toolchains rather than
              adopt more opinionated frameworks.

              Although it’s easy to learn and deploy—making it popular among
              students for custom routines and games—its execution speed and
              memory are limited compared to compiled or desktop languages, so
              programmers often optimize code by minimizing loops, using
              built-in functions, or writing critical routines in assembly.
