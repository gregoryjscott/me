desc: >-
  Amazon Cognito is a managed user identity and access management tool that
  provides authentication, authorization, and user directory services for web
  and mobile applications. It supports standard protocols (OAuth 2.0, OpenID
  Connect, SAML), social identity providers, and customizable authentication
  flows. Itâ€™s commonly used to implement sign-up/sign-in, token-based session
  management, and multi-factor authentication without building custom identity
  infrastructure.
