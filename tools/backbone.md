TODO - add Backbone website link

I like to think of Backbone as simply a way of organizing your web application JavaScript code using the concepts of Routers, Models, and Views. Routers give you a way to react to browser URL changes, Models give you a way to interact with a REST based backend to retrieve and persist data, and Views give you place to stick code that is responsible for a specific DOM element. That's all that Backbone does - the rest is up to you to implement.

Personally, I like this power. I've used Backbone about 10 times 10 different ways because each time I had different needs in the client side application. In all cases I supplemented Backbone with other open source JavaScript libraries to get the job done.
