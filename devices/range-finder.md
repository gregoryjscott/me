title: Laser Range Finder
desc: >-
  A laser range finder is an optical device that measures distance by emitting a
  laser pulse toward a target and calculating range from the time-of-flight of
  the reflected signal. It delivers high-precision, non-contact measurement data
  used in surveying, robotics, industrial inspection and mapping. Its compact
  design and real-time output facilitate integration into automated systems
  requiring accurate spatial information.
