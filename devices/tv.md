  Television (TV) is an electronic device that receives and decodes broadcast,
  cable or streaming video signals, rendering them on flat-panel displays via
  digital signal processors and multimedia codecs. It integrates networking
  protocols (e.g. Wi-Fi, Ethernet) and application platforms to manage content
  delivery, user interaction and remote control. Common use cases include home
  entertainment, news and information consumption, and interactive digital
  signage in commercial environments.
