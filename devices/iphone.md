  The iPhone is a smartphone device by Apple that combines a multi-touch
  display, sensors (e.g. accelerometer, GPS, camera) and the iOS operating
  system to run native and web-based applications. Itâ€™s commonly used for voice
  and video communication, messaging, web browsing, photography and as a
  platform for mobile app development and deployment. Its tight
  hardware-software integration and standardized app distribution model have
  shaped modern mobile ecosystems.
