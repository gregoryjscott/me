  Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation technology
  that calculates precise geographic coordinates by measuring signal travel
  times from a constellation of Earth-orbiting satellites. Commonly employed in
  mapping and turn-by-turn navigation, asset tracking, and location-based
  services, GPS delivers real-time positioning with meter-level accuracy across
  devices from smartphones to IoT sensors.
