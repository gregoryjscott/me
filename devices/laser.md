  FLIR Laser is a laser rangefinding module integrated into FLIR thermal imaging
  devices that emits near-infrared pulses and measures their time-of-flight to
  calculate precise target distances. Itâ€™s commonly used in industrial
  inspection, surveying, search and rescue, and defense for accurate target
  acquisition and scene analysis under low-visibility conditions.
