I've programmed servers, PC, Macs, smartphones, tablets, mainframes, hand-held range finders, GPS devices, lasers mounted to planes, calculators, and B-1 Bombers. __Programming is my passion.__

My [projects](/projects) have used an impressive spectrum of [languages](/languages), tools, and [databases](/db). I love to learn new technologies.

I'm currently searching for my next challenge. Please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:me@gregoryjscott.com">contact me</a> if I might be of service to you.
