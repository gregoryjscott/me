For 20 years I've learned new software languages, libraries, frameworks, databases, operating systems, products, and services. It never gets old.

I've programmed PCs, Macs, mainframes, hand-held range finders, GPS devices, a laser mounted to single-engine plane, smartphones, tablets, calculators, and B-1 Bombers.

My favorite space continues to be the web; both front-end and back-end development.

I love open source, of course.

My current passions are web APIs, polyglot programming, and civic hacking.

I really enjoy working with designers and writers.

In the summertime I drive a combine. I also like traveling, skiing, baseball, and bicycles.
