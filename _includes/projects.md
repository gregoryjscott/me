SAR
- Don't recall what SAR stands for
- .NET, C#, SQL, ASP.NET Web Forms, HTML, CSS
- Basically a set of reports that used the ReportEngine. I remember attempting to simplify the code by introducing some base classes. It did in fact lead to less lines of code, but the new set of base classes introduce a new concept that was different than all other ReportEngine implementations. This led to me thinking that every day used of inheritance isn't good. It takes to long for others to conceptionalize the whole hierarchy of classes before they can make any change to the code.
