title: C
desc: C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed in the
  early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It is a low-level language, meaning it can be
  used to control hardware and memory, and is often used for system programming.
  C is a compiled language, meaning that it is converted into machine code
  before being executed. It is also a structured language, meaning that it is
  organized into functions, which can be called from other parts of the program.
  C is widely used in many applications, including operating systems, embedded
  systems, and scientific computing.
