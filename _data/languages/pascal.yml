title: Pascal
desc: Pascal is a procedural programming language developed in the late 1960s by
  Niklaus Wirth. It is a high-level language, meaning it is designed to be
  easier to read and write than low-level languages like assembly. Pascal is a
  strongly typed language, meaning that all variables must be declared with a
  specific type before they can be used. It is also a structured language,
  meaning that programs are broken down into smaller, manageable parts. Pascal
  is widely used in education and is the basis for many other languages, such as
  Object Pascal and Delphi.
