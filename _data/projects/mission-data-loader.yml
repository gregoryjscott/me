  After graduating with a degree in Mathematics from [UCO](/schools/uco/), I was
  hired as an Embedded Software Engineer at [Boeing's Defense and Space
  Group](/jobs/boeing/) in Oklahoma City. I joined the Controls and Displays
  team for the B-1 Bomber's Block E software upgrade, a complete rewrite of the
  avionics system. My primary responsibility was to implement the Mission Data
  Loader, the core component responsible for distributing mission-critical data
  (including flight plans, target coordinates, and weapon configurations) to all
  other subsystems.


  The central nature of this module required constant interaction with every
  other team on the 100+ person project. This forced me to quickly develop the
  professional communication and collaboration skills essential to a large-scale
  engineering effort. I designed and implemented a publish-subscribe interface
  for data distribution and became the go-to expert for debugging the system’s
  complex, multi-threaded codebase. As a result of this cross-cutting role, my
  work became highly visible, and my contributions were known throughout the
  project.


  To this day, it’s a source of pride knowing that, for a time, every B-1
  mission began with a crew member inserting a cartridge and running my code.


  ## Key Takeaway


  I learned how to be a professional programmer on this project. I was given a
  critical task, delivered on it, and earned my place as a core member of a
  high-performing team.

      desc: Ada 95 is a high-level, structured, statically typed, object-oriented
        programming language designed for real-time, embedded, and distributed
        systems. It is an international standard language, and is the most
        recent version of the Ada language. It is designed to be reliable,
        efficient, and maintainable, and is suitable for a wide range of
        applications. It supports strong typing, modularity, generics, exception
        handling, and object-oriented programming. It also has a wide range of
        libraries and tools for development, debugging, and testing.
