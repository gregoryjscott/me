title: Amplify
desc: AWS Amplify is a comprehensive development platform from Amazon Web
  Services that enables developers to quickly build, deploy, and manage scalable
  full-stack web and mobile applications. It provides a set of libraries, UI
  components and a command-line interface for integrating popular front-end
  frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, iOS, Android, Flutter) with cloud backends,
  including authentication, GraphQL and REST APIs, storage, and serverless
  functions. Amplify Studio offers a visual development environment for
  designing UI and data models, while built-in hosting, CI/CD and environment
  management streamline the application lifecycle so teams can focus on features
  instead of infrastructure.
