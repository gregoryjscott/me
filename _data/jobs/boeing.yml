  - Architected and delivered the Mission Data Loader, a mission-critical
  interface that all other avionics teams depended on for distributing flight
  plans, target coordinates, and weapon configurations.

  - Ensured mission continuity during hardware failures by developing a suite of
  backup displays that provided full redundancy for critical input devices like
  keypads and switch panels.

  - Functioned as a key contributor to both the Controls & Displays and the core
  System Management Function teams, developing the displays used to monitor the
  B-1's custom-built avionics operating system.
